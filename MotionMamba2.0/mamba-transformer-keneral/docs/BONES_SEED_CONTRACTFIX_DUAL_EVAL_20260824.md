# BONES-SEED Contract-Fix Table 4/5 Evaluation

## Status

This report evaluates three 50k denoiser checkpoints on the
actor-disjoint BONES-SEED v004 G1 split under the `canonical_history_v2` contract.
The released ARDY-G1 representation frontend and tokenizer/decoder are shared;
released Rigplay mixer weights are excluded from all three architecture rows.
The original ARDY run was invalidated after its root output branch collapsed. The
replacement resumes the stable fresh-mixer 5k checkpoint at learning rate `1e-5`,
continues to 50k total steps, and must pass fixed-dev-loss and root-output-norm gates.

| Method | Checkpoint | Training status |
|---|---|---|
| ARDY stabilized retrain | `/data4/zts/result/bones_seed_ardy_retrain_lr1e5_20260826_original/original_humanml3d_ddp.pt` | PASS, 50k, finite gradients, 4.14 h |
| Minimal contract-fix | `/data4/zts/result/bones_seed_contract_full50k_20260824_minimal/minimal_humanml3d_ddp.pt` | PASS, 50k, finite gradients, 6.53 h |
| Hybrid contract-fix | `/data4/zts/result/bones_seed_contract_full50k_20260824_hybrid/hybrid_humanml3d_ddp.pt` | PASS, 50k, finite gradients, 8.39 h |

All nine evaluation jobs completed with `status=PASS`. Every model used the same
test manifest, seed `20260824`, 64 samples per protocol, batch size 4, 10 diffusion
steps, CFG text/constraint weights 2/2, SDPA attention, and identical sample IDs
within each protocol. Table 4 uses a 52-frame panel. Table 5 follows ARDY Section 6.3:
a nine-second, 225-frame sequence with a tokenizer-aligned 24-frame (0.96 s) GT prefix
and 201 generated frames. Table 5 in/out use the same motion IDs.

| Protocol | Fixed panel SHA-256 |
|---|---|
| Table 4 | `fe9d8c63b8c7f8cc45e0d4f43874cd065b29ca462a2dc119718adad3f2e0e8bd` |

For Table 5, Minimal and Hybrid prime the GT prefix once and then use persistent
cache-only rollout (`protocol_guard=gt_prefix_primed_cache_only`). ARDY has no
adapter-owned persistent state and uses native explicit autoregressive history.

## Dataset and Split

| Split | Assigned motions | Eligible motions (>=52 frames) | Actors | Invalid CSVs |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Train | 125,258 | 123,651 | 463 | 0 |
| Val | 7,578 | 7,450 | 31 | 0 |
| Test | 9,384 | 9,222 | 28 | 0 |

The SHA-256 actor split has zero actor overlap. All eligible rows have captions.
Because several categories have too few contributing actors, the test split contains no eligible samples for: `Environments`, `Household`, `Looking and Pointing`, `Martial Arts`. This category-coverage limitation must be considered when interpreting aggregate results.

The model-native source is the 120 fps G1 CSV archive, deterministically resampled to 25 fps
and represented as 414-D explicit / 418-D dual-root statistics. All three downloaded
archives passed exact-size and gzip validation; SOMA is retained as dataset material but is
not silently retargeted into the G1 experiment.

## Official BONES-SEED Track

BONES-SEED has no locally available calibrated retrieval/FID or MoBench evaluator. These
values remain `N/A`; HumanML3D embeddings are not substituted as official BONES-SEED scores.

| Method | R-Precision Top-3 | FID | FVMD | TM-Sim |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| ARDY stabilized retrain | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Minimal contract-fix | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Hybrid contract-fix | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

## Table 4 proxy: Offline Text and Joint-Position Control

This protocol uses the 52-frame native G1 in-horizon generation panel. Lower is better for
every reported metric.

| Method | Constraint Error (cm) | Root ADE (cm) | Root FDE (cm) | PA-MPJPE (cm) | Jitter (m/frame2) | Angle MAE (deg) | Skate proxy (%) | Latency (s/sample) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| ARDY stabilized retrain (50k) | 52.91 | 55.39 | 65.89 | 18.02 | **0.02200** | 15.32 | **38.47** | **0.0276** |

## Table 5: ARDY-Paper-Aligned 9-Second Autoregressive Control

In-horizon places one sampled pelvis/wrist/foot position goal at the end of every
generation window. Out-of-horizon places one goal only at the final frame, beyond the
initial generation window. Metrics exclude the GT prefix and cover generated frames only.

| Method | Protocol | Constraint Error (cm) | Root ADE (cm) | Root FDE (cm) | PA-MPJPE (cm) | Jitter (m/frame2) | Angle MAE (deg) | Skate proxy (%) | Latency (s/sample) |

## 20/40-Second Long-Sequence Supplement

The supplement uses the same 20 test motions that are each at least 40 seconds long.
The 20-second crop and 40-second crop share the same motion ID and source start, and all
three models receive identical text, goals, diffusion noise, and CFG settings. Window 5
is the first generation window that reads memory after the four-chunk attention cache has
evicted the GT-prefix chunk. Slopes are least-squares growth rates from windows 6 onward;
lower values indicate slower post-window-5 degradation.

### 40-Second Window Trace: Hybrid vs Minimal

| 8 | 193.55 | 194.68 | 191.46 | 191.39 |
| 9 | 197.40 | 185.79 | 188.40 | 175.58 |

| 11 | 166.06 | 172.82 | 153.44 | 166.37 |
| 12 | 152.21 | 172.34 | 148.51 | 181.37 |
| 13 | 169.55 | 185.02 | 173.80 | 193.22 |
| 14 | 175.67 | 197.59 | 171.34 | 201.57 |
| 15 | 172.56 | 194.02 | 164.40 | 191.20 |
| 16 | 177.92 | 201.43 | 176.52 | 204.17 |
| 17 | 181.98 | 211.07 | 172.64 | 214.12 |
| 18 | 174.82 | 222.28 | 157.81 | 220.88 |
| 19 | 150.29 | 212.57 | 145.24 | 214.92 |

At 40 seconds, Hybrid first exceeds Minimal Root ADE at window 8; its post-window-5 Hybrid-Minimal gap grows by 4.899 cm per window and reaches 62.28 cm in the final window. The current checkpoint therefore does not establish a 40-second Hybrid advantage. Training exposes the recurrent state to only one teacher-history commit followed by one generated window, so repeated-state rollout is an out-of-distribution regime and can accumulate Mamba-state bias. This negative result is kept separate from the healthy nine-second result.

## Boundary and Interpretation

| Method | Table 5 in max boundary speed (m/s) | Table 5 out max boundary speed (m/s) | Eval peak memory (MiB, max) | Active mixer parameters |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| ARDY stabilized retrain (50k) | 4.46 | 5.29 | 1540.7 | 147,150,996 |
| Minimal contract-fix (50k) | 6.44 | 3.47 | 2305.9 | 247,914,644 |
| Hybrid contract-fix (50k) | 4.92 | 2.08 | 2971.5 | 352,578,724 |

On the fixed panels, Hybrid contract-fix has the lowest Table 4 constraint error; ARDY stabilized retrain and Hybrid contract-fix have the lowest Table 5 in-horizon and out-of-horizon constraint errors respectively. Bold values identify the global minimum
within each protocol and metric. These paired geometry and physical proxies support only
this fixed BONES-SEED protocol; they do not establish an official leaderboard result.
Hybrid improves Table 5 constraint error over Minimal by 8.45% in-horizon and 15.84%
out-of-horizon. It also has the lowest Root ADE/FDE, PA-MPJPE, jitter, and skate proxy
in both protocols; Minimal retains the lowest Angle MAE. This supports a broad nine-second
long-rollout advantage on BONES-SEED while keeping the metric-specific exception explicit.

Latency was measured in parallel on separate GPUs and is suitable for within-run comparison
only. A systems claim requires serialized warm-up and identical GPU/timing isolation.
